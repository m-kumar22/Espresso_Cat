                    <h1>Oolong Tea</h1>
                    <p>Oolong, also spelled Wu Long, teas are semi-oxidized. Oolong teas have long been <br> cultivated in both mainland China and Taiwan. In general, larger, mature leaves are picked, <br> withered, rolled, oxidized, and then fired. The leaves can be allowed to oxidize between 10% <br> to 80%. Often, different tea estates have their preferred ways of making oolong tea. It is <br> because of the intricacy of this process that oolong teas can have the widest array of flavors <br> and aromas. Furthermore, oolongs can be steeped several time, with each successive infusion <br> having its own distinctive taste and fragrance.</p>

                    <h1>Green Tea</h1>
                    <p>Because they are unoxidized, green teas keep their vital color. To prevent <br> oxidization, the leaves are heat processed to eliminate the enzyme responsible for <br> oxidization. This is generally done by roasting or pan-firing the leaves. This style <br> of processing tends to bring out a mouthwatering range of flavors from citrus- <br> like to smoky with a lighter body. The color of the liquor is usually not a true <br> "green", but a pale yellow or straw color.</p>

                    <h1>Black Tea</h1>
                    <p>Black tea is the most well-known variety of tea in the West. Known as "red tea" <br> in China, black tea leaves are fully oxidized. In the case of most black teas, <br> younger leaves are picked before being withered, rolled, fully oxidized, and fired. <br> Our black teas are entirely done by hand. Machine-processed teas tend to be of <br> lower quality and are generally used in tea bags.</p>

                    <h1>Tisanes Tea</h1>
                    <p>Herbal And Floral Infusions. At ITO EN, we prefer the term "tisane" in order <br> to properly distinguish tea from other infusions. The advantage of tisanes is that <br> they are generally caffeine-free and gentle on the body, making them an <br> excellent choice for children in particular. Often, tisanes have their own <br> particular benefits, as is the case South African Rooibos, which is naturally high <br> in vitamin C and antioxidants.</p>
